# crud-draft
Draft of CRUD, (Create Read Update Delete), web application with Spring Boot, H2 and Vaadin.
Once you have downloaded the generic project template generated on the Spring Initializr website, 
with the specific requests you can deduce from the pom file, 
you can import it into the preferred IDE and add the source files present here. 
Please, be careful to the proper package system of the Java language. 
If you want to use Spring Boot 2.0.0.RELEASE instead of Spring Boot 1.5.10.RELEASE, 
you will need to comment or delete a line of code that is not valid for Spring Boot 2.0.0.RELEASE 
and uncomment the working code line in EndUserCrud.java. 
Thank you.
